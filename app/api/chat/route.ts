Benefits of SIP:
â€¢ Rupee Cost Averaging: Reduces impact of market volatility
â€¢ Disciplined Investing: Builds a habit of regular investment
â€¢ Power of Compounding: Your returns generate more returns
â€¢ Flexibility: Start with as little as â‚¹500 per month

Would you like to know more about how to start a SIP?`;
